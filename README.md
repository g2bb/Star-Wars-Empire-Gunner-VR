# Star-Wars-Empire-Gunner-VR

This is a modified version of my Midterm project for Intro to VR Development at MU. It's too big to upload here on Github, so you can find the source code here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IvO2jQXn_kvoGwhX6DIrZjdH_C6wQdWc?usp=sharing

It was developed in unity, but it is still a work in progress, so I have not built it out yet.
